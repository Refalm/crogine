    \brief Used to decide by which criteria 2D drawables are sorted.
    Drawables are sorted by the given axis of their transform in the
    following order:
    DepthAxis::Y - Drawables are rendered from top to bottom order,
    so that the lower on the Y axis they are positioned the later they
    are drawn (ie Drawables nearer the bottom will be drawn over the
    top of Drawables nearer the top of the view). Useful for top-down
    tile map style rendering
    DepthAxis::Z - Drawables are drawn in the order in which their Z
    values appear - smaller Z values are drawn first with larget Z values
    drawn over the top. Z values can be set in the entities Transform component.
